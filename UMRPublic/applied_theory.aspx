<H3 align=left>AppliedTheory Teams with Universal Medical Records</H3>
<P>AppliedTheory Corporation, a leading Tier 1 provider of Internet business solutions, announced that it has signed a significant contract with Universal Medical Records (UMR), a privately held medical technology company at the forefront of medical records integration. Under terms of the contract, AppliedTheory will Web-enable UMR's proprietary database application, Virtual UMRPublic Navigator, for use by hospitals, insurers and patients.</P>
<P>"AppliedTheory has a long tradition of supporting the healthcare market with high-end applications," said Dr. Richard Mandelbaum, AppliedTheory Chairman &amp; CEO. "Our partnership with UMR exemplifies our strategy of providing the healthcare market with best-of-breed products and services that exceed the expectations and unique needs of this community faced with great challenges in both effectiveness and efficiency."</P>
<P>UMR's unique database application, Virtual Medical Navigator, is designed specifically to allow both patients and health care organizations to retrieve medical records on demand via the Internet. Furthermore, Virtual UMRPublic Navigator will link together patients, doctors and insurers to streamline the fragmented mosaic of health and medical records systems currently in place. Once AppliedTheory creates the linkages among various back-end databases, UMR's application and front-end Web browsers, any patient or medical provider anywhere in the world will have the ability to access and locate medical records for emergency, follow-up or first time treatment.</P>
<P>"Healthcare organizations understand that empowering consumers is a powerful strategy, and UMR shares this vision," said Steven C. Cohn, M.D., UMR's CEO. "We've developed a navigational tool that can globally manage and integrate medical records for immediate access and delivery-on a restricted and confidential basis-for patients and healthcare providers. AppliedTheory's expertise and superior record of achievement in the healthcare market are critical factors in bringing this tool to market."</P>
<P>According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, transactions between hospitals, doctors and insurers must be standardized by 2002, including implementation of an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to reduce administrative costs, prevent fraudulent activity and protect patient privacy. "The size of the medical records market is estimated to be $250 billion," said C. Peter Waegemann, Executive Director, Medical Records Institute. "UMR and AppliedTheory are on the leading edge of EDI development and medical records integration."</P>
<P>"AppliedTheory continues to work with world-class institutions, including Memorial Sloan Kettering, John's Hopkins, and the New York State Department of Health, to make the healthcare experience more efficient and cost-effective," said Joseph LaManna, AppliedTheory vice president of vertical markets and major accounts. "As UMR's needs grow from Web-enablement to Web-hosting, AppliedTheory will tailor a solution for optimum performance and reliability."</P>
